    text: The premise of the game is that time only moves when you move. You play as Frozone from the incredibles and travel from floor to floor dodging bullets and killing enemies. This was made at a CodeDay Chicago event in under 24 hours with a few of my friends. For such a small time frame I'm very happy with how it came out, the time slowing effect came out feeling pretty natural and we added a few tracing effects to emphasize it. What I wish we could have improved on was spending a little more time on art and instructions for players and maybe adding a few more levels to the mix.
