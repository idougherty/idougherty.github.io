                            This was built with a custom physics engine and uses a procedural track 
                            generator so each race is different. In order to acheive responsive realtime
                            physics, client-side prediction and server reconciliation are used. Latency is
                            is minimized by keeping packages small using avro serialization.

                            This was built using a variety of techniques I found on various 
                            physics engine forums to optimize for a realtime browser environment. 
                            Collisions use sweep and prune for the broadphase, then GJK and EPA for the 
                            narrow phase. The collisions are then handled with an iterative impulse 
                            resolution system.

                            This engine uses quaternion rotation to represent the camera and the painter's 
                            algorithm of drawing polygons. Polygons in the mesh are sorted back to front
                            in a binary search tree and then pulled out for shading in order.
                            Hold down the mouse to look around and use WASD to move.

                            I used this project as a practice on how to apply quaternion rotation and projection
                            before I added it into a polygonal rendering context. I added a few different attractors
                            each with mutltiple particles that generate trails.
